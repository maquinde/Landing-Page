# Landing Page

This is my solution for the Udacity Frontend Developer Landing Page project.

## What I Did

I created a dynamic navigation bar with list items that scroll smoothly to their corisponding sections when clicked. After clicking the list item, the section that is in view will be highlighted in the navigation.
